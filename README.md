## 🔥 News
* `2025/04/05` Update: Self-host Lean State Search is available!
* `2025/03/07` Update: [LeanSearchClient](https://github.com/leanprover-community/LeanSearchClient) now supports query Lean State Search from within Lean.
* `2025/03/05` Update: Lean State Search is now publicly available!




## 🧩 About

Lean State Search is an innovative search engine powered by a pretrained model, specifically designed to help mathematicians and Lean4 users efficiently search Mathlib theorems using proof states. It is developed by the AI4Math team at Renmin University of China.

This repository contains the frontend and backend code for the application. You can setup your own server for deployment of Lean State Search.

## ⚒️ Installation

This project uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) for development dependency management. We recommend installing `nix` using the script provided by [zero-to-nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install/).

After installing `nix`, run the following command to enter development environment.

```shell
nix develop
```

You should first download our model from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ruc-ai4math/LeanStateSearch2025.3). Run the following command:

```shell
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/ruc-ai4math/LeanStateSearch2025.3
```

You also need to fill in the necessary environment variables in the `.env` file. First, copy the `.env.example` to `.env`:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Here is an example project structure:
```
LeanStateSearch
├── LeanStateSearch2025.3
├── data
├── protos
├── scripts
├── lean-state-search
├── state-search-be
├── Makefile
├── lib.nix
├── flake.lock
├── compose.yaml
├── flake.nix
├── shell.nix
├── .env
└── README.md
```

The `MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH` environment variable should be the absolute path to the model.

We recommend using docker for deployment. Run the following command to build the images of frontend and backend:

```shell
make build-images
```

Then run the command to start the service:

```shell
make init-service
```

After starting the basic services, you need to prepare the data yourself. We provide premises extracted from `v4.16.0` of Mathlib as an example. You can use existing tools like [ntp-toolkit](https://github.com/cmu-l3/ntp-toolkit) to extract data. Run the following command to upload data to the postgresql database.

```shell
cd state-search-be
poetry run python scripts/upload_theorem.py --data-path ../data/premise4.16.0.jsonl --rev v4.16.0
```

Then run the following command to create vector store. It will take some time depending on the hardware of your computer.

```shell
# In state-search-be/
poetry run python scripts/create_vector_store.py --rev v4.16.0
```

Now your application can work properly in `http://localhost:${FRONTEND_PORT}`.

## 📖 References

### Training from scratch

The code for training the model from scratch and reproducing the experimental results of our paper can be found [here](https://github.com/ruc-ai4math/Premise-Retrieval).

### API documentation

The application can be accessed through API requests. You can refer to [LeanSearchClient](https://github.com/leanprover-community/LeanSearchClient) as an example. The format is as follows:

```
https://localhost:${FRONTEND_PORT}/api/search?query=${Your query}&results=${result number}&rev=${revision}
```
