[ ] Migrate Python backend build system from Poetry ➔ Hatchling PEP 621 and use `uv` for dependency resolution/install.
    • Converted `state-search-be/pyproject.toml` and added `__version__`.
    • Remove Poetry from docs; replace with `uv pip install --editable .` workflow.

[ ] Provide idempotent model downloader.
    • Added `scripts/setup_model.py` which git-clones if missing.

[ ] Make Mathlib revision fully pluggable.
    • Confirmed existing pipeline already takes `--rev`; create convenience wrapper that auto-detects latest mathlib tag and re-ingests vector store.

[ ] Update documentation (README, Justfile) to reflect uv + hatch.

[ ] Add Git hooks for Ruff, MyPy, and pre-commit formatting.
